                <property name="capt:sidecar-forknote-reason">The fork was initiated to implement a modification in the Conan recipe. The original recipe had a dependency on fmt library at version '10.1.1'. However, this created a dependency conflict with our project which uses fmt at '10.2.1' so the upgrade to version '10.2.1' was necessary for the successful execution of our project.</property>
                <property name="capt:sidecar-forknote-eol"> The necessity for this fork will cease when the upstream project upgrades the fmt dependency version to '10.2.1'.</property>
                <property name="capt:sidecar-forknote-maintenance"> The maintenance of this fork may require periodic pulls from the upstream project to ensure alignment with the latest updates and improvements. There exists a possibility for contributing changes back to the upstream project. This is contingent on the relevance and applicability of these changes to the broader user base of the upstream project. Such contributions are made as required and are in line with the collaborative spirit of open-source development. </property>
